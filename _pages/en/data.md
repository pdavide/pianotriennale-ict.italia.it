Data from the Public Administrations, together with the mechanisms and platforms created to provide services to citizens, are one of the major digital assets of the PA. To best exploit their potential, it is necessary to abandon the approach based on watertight compartments in favour of a systemic vision.

The Plan has identified three areas of action for exploiting public information assets: databases of national interest, open data and controlled vocabularies.

Databases constitute the backbone of public information assets, and must be made available to all PAs, facilitating the exchange of data and avoiding the need to ask citizens or enterprises for the same information over and over again.

Open data require a process where public data managed by the PAs are made open and free for reuse and redistribution, the only exception being data subject to specific restrictions.

Controlled vocabularies and data models are useful in facilitating data exchanges among PAs via codes and shared ontologies.
