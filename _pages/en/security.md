Security is of fundamental importance, as it guarantees the availability, integrity and confidentiality of information in the Public Administration's Information System. It is also directly connected to the principles of privacy determined by law. The role of [CERT-PA](https://www.cert-pa.it/) is therefore being strengthened to structure the security plans of the Public Administrations and to ensure the implementation of the plans by means of periodic monitoring and checks.

The Plan, taking into account the National Strategic Framework for Cyberspace Security (QNS), emphasises the rationalisation of the ICT resources as the primary method to increase the security level by reducing the &quot;surface&quot; exposed to computer attacks.
