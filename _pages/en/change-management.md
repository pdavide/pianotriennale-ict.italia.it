To achieve the objectives defined by the Three-Year Plan, it is essential to coordinate a variety of subjects differing in role, function and organisation, all sharing a common call to participate in the implementation of the national strategy.

The Agency for Digital Italy (AgID), which has the task of leading the activities related to the strategic evolution of the Public Administration&#39;s IT system, defines a governance model that guarantees:
- support in the implementation of the Plan, with initiatives aimed at facilitating and training the Public Administrations involved in the digital transformation process;
- monitoring the implementation activities with respect to two macro areas:
  - technical aspects; the aim is to verify the implementation of the planned actions, through a set of indicators of achievement and results, the latter to be linked to the DESI indicators, where possible;
  - economic aspects; this part is related to the systematic collection of data on ICT expenditure by the administrations. The aim is to verify the progress made in terms of savings and to reroute those funds towards investments.

To achieve the objectives outlined above, AgID will:
- assist the selected PAs in their role of aggregator in the implementation of organisational and instrumental activities;
- promote the fulfilment of the administrations' obligation to identify the office responsible for the digital transition, as per Article 17 of the CAD (Digital Administration Code).
