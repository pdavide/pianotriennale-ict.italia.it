The definition of an interoperability model is a cornerstone of the entire Public Information System. This ensures that PAs are able to interact and exchange information without the need for specific integrations. Hence, it is possible to guarantee full cooperation between Public Administrations and private subjects.

In this process of creation and consolidation of a new interoperability model, AgID is involved in the definition of technical rules, guidelines, technological standards and profiles that each PA must adopt.

The objective is to create technological conditions that favour the development of innovative solutions focused around citizens, businesses and the Administrations themselves.
