The [Data &amp; Analytics Framework](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/projects/daf.htm) (DAF) is one of the main activities for the enhancement of national public information assets. Its main goals are: developing and simplifying the interoperability of public data between the PAs, standardising and promoting the dissemination of open data, optimising the processes of data analysis and knowledge generation. The idea is to open up the world of Public Administration to the benefits offered by modern platforms for big data management and analysis, acting along four main lines:
- increase the value of PA's information assets through the use of big data technologies that allow for the creation of knowledge and that drastically reduce analysis times;
- encourage and optimise the exchange of data between the PAs, minimising the transaction costs for access and use;
- encourage the dissemination of open data and make its use more effective;
- favour the exploratory analysis of data by data scientist teams, both within individual PAs and at a central level, to improve awareness of social phenomena.

The DAF will allow for the promotion of scientific research initiatives on issues of particular interest to the PAs, encouraging collaboration with universities and research bodies.
